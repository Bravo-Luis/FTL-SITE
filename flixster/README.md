### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I feel like there was alot to explore with APIs that we didn't really get to, and I didn't really know how to navigate it. We were given a pretty basic example with the labs and lectures and built my project on the main now playing api at first becuase I didn't know you could use things like query and page parameters, so I ended up having to change up alot of my code a few times

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have definitely made it look much better, and added a few more accessibility features. I was really busy with school this week but I'm proud of what I was able to make.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Didn't do a demo this week
